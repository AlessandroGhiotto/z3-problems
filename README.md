# Z3 problems

I used the SMT-solver z3 to solve the following problems.

1. three color problem: color the graph so that no two adjacent vertices are colored with the same color.
2. knights and knaves: knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie
3. domoino tiles: adjacent cells from different tiles need to have the same number
4. A shepherd must ferry a wolf, a sheep, and a cabbage from one side of a river to the other...
5. game of fifteen
6. konigsberg seven bridges
7. peg game
8. hanoi tower
